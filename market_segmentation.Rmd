If NutrientH20 wants to hone its messages more to its current social-media audience, they should create online-advertising campaigns centered around:

* Health & Wellness Enthusiasts
* Lifestyle & Aesthetic Enthusiasts
* Informed & Tech-Savvy Travelers
* Family & Faith-Oriented
* Shoppers & Current Events Followers.
